## Project info

* #### Proposal Title: “_ATTENDANCE SYSTEM- USING QR CODE_”

>_This attendance system software is an android based software for students to scan QR code for attendance._.

* #### Proposal Abstract:

_In this project, we are implementing a new idea for taking attendance in the institutes through the use of QR codes. QR code (abbreviated from Quick Response Code) is the trademark for a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode). For this we are using an Android Application which will scan the code from the students and will upload the attendance accordingly. We are also using Client-Server architecture for saving the attendance. By doing so, our aim is to modernize the way in which attendance is taken at institutes. This system can be implemented in schools and places where attendance is mandatory. No extra hardware is needed in this system except an Android Mobile for taking the attendance and a Computer System with which we can access the server to check the status of students. Languages to be used in this project are XML, JAVA, SQL, HTML, JSP and ANDROID network programming._.





* #### Future Scope of this project are:

    * Instead of taking attendance manually or fingerprint scanning or biometrics we will provide the QR codes to student which they will use to give their attendance.
    * Data can be exported into different type of document formats. 
    * With this system, transparency will be more in managing attendance; and reports can be generated easily.
    * Easy to use.
